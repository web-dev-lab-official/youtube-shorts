“Your MongoDB schema is probably already wrong.”

“Not because of the fields… but because of how you designed it.”

“Most beginners design MongoDB like SQL.”

“They ask: what tables do I need?”

“But MongoDB doesn’t care about tables.”

“MongoDB cares about how your app READS data.”

“If one screen needs three queries… your schema already failed.”

“That’s like putting your phone charger at the bottom of your backpack.”

“Every time you need it, you unpack everything.”

“In MongoDB, joins are expensive.”

“So instead of splitting data…”

“You often EMBED the data you read together.”

“One query.”

“Faster app.”

“Happier users.”

“The rule is simple.”

“Design for reads, not for storage.”

“Before writing your schema…”

“Write your queries first.”
